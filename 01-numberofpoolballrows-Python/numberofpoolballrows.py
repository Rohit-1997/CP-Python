# Pool balls are arranged in balls where the first row contains 1 pool ball and each row contains 1
# more pool ball than the previous row. 
# numberOfPoolBallRows(balls) that takes a non-negative int number of pool balls, and returns the 
# smallest int number of balls required for the given number of pool balls. Thus, numberOfPoolBallRows(6) 
# returns 3. Note that if any balls must be in a row, then you count that row, and so 
# numberOfPoolBallRows(7) returns 4 (since the 4th row must have a single ball in it).
