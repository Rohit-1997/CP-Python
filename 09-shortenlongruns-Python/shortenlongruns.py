# shortenLongRuns(L, k) [15 pts]
# Write the non-destructive function shortenLongRuns(L, k) that takes a list L and a positive integer k, and 
# non-destructively returns a similar list, only without any run of k consecutive equal values in L. This means that 
# any values that would otherwise produce a consecutive run of k elements are not present. 
# For example: 
# assert(shortenLongRuns([2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3], 2) == [2, 3, 5, 3]) 
# assert(shortenLongRuns([2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3], 3) == [2, 3, 5, 5, 3]) 
# Note: your function may not just create a copy of L and call the destructive version of this function (below) on 
# that copy and return it. Instead, you must directly construct the result here.
